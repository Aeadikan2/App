bookings.provider_id → profiles.id
bookings.service_id → services.id
disputes.booking_id → bookings.id
disputes.customer_id → profiles.id
disputes.provider_id → profiles.id

const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'test@example.com',
  password: 'password123'
})

// Test RLS - will only return user's own profile
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .single()

// Test service browsing - returns only active services
const { data: services } = await supabase
  .from('services')
  .select('*, provider:profiles(*), category:categories(*)')
  .eq('is_active', true)
```
